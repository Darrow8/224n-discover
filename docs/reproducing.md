# Reproducing Results

## Setup

To run a job, create and activate a Conda environment, then install the required dependencies for the task you want to run.

- **gpu_mode** Conda environments must use **Python 3.13.11**
- All other tasks are recommended to use **Python 3.11**

Each task has its own `requirements.txt` located under:

requirements/

Install dependencies with the application-specific requirements:
- Math: `requirements/requirements-math.txt`
- GPU kernels: `requirements/requirements-gpumode.txt`
- AtCoder: `requirements/requirements-ale.txt`  
- Denoising: `requirements/denoising/requirements-denoising.txt` (see [README](requirements/denoising/README.md))

## Running Tasks

After installing dependencies, locate the corresponding application script under:

scripts/

Each application provides a script in `env.py` that launches the job. Run it with:

```
python -m examples.<task_dir>.env
```

## Multi-node Execution

Multi-node execution is supported via Slurm.

## Hardware Requirements and Performance Notes

All reported results were run using HPC-grade CPUs.

Mathematics and AHC tasks will perform significantly worse if they are not run on HPC-grade CPUs or if they are limited to a small number of cores. For these tasks, it is strongly recommended to use a large number of CPU cores and multiple hosts.

## AHC Container Requirements

For AHC tasks, jobs must be launched inside the ALE-Bench provided C++ container:

yimjk/ale-bench:cpp20-202301

Docker Hub:
https://hub.docker.com/layers/yimjk/ale-bench/cpp20-202301/images/sha256-946af1b209a84160594e43262b5157aec933938c99e2585b53042cac9bc3f43c

We support the Pyxis Slurm plugin to launch this container across multiple nodes for AHC, but it is not strictly required.
